# Main Menu Changer

Main menu changer is a bakkesmod plugin that allows you to vhange the location of the car and the camera in the main menu.

You can create presets, save, and load them.

# Imprtant Note

The plugin isn't fully tested, I don't really know if the plugin is 100% working but I tested changing the car's and camera's location and it was working well, not sure abbout the presets feature.

It's an old project that I totally forgot about and that I've never published on bakkesplugins.com, so I don't recommand you to use it since it could have bugs.
